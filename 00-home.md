#  THE **MERN** STACK â€” TUTORIAL

## Home

The MERN stack is a popular combination of several technologies which use only JavaScript. In other words, you can develop full-stack web applications using only JavaScript. In the MERN stack, you'll combine the amazing powers of client-side framework **[React](https://reactjs.org)** with server-side technologies such as **[Node](https://nodejs.org)**, **[Express](https://expressjs.com)**, and **[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)** to develop real-world full-stack web applications. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build the back-end of the web application using Node, Express, MongoDB and integrate it to the front-end, which we create using React and Chakra UI.

## Audience

This tutorial is for anyone who already knows JavaScript and wants to develop full-stack web applications using the JavaScript stack. This tutorial is like a foundation for getting practical experience with developing blazing-fast full-stack web applications for real-world applications.

## Prerequisites

As an aspiring full-stack web developer, you should have some intermediate level knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before starting this tutorial. You should have some understanding and be comfortable using React as a front-end framework. I recommend completing this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/) before continuing with this one for a better understanding of React. It would be a plus if you already have some basic understanding of Node, Express, and MongoDB.
