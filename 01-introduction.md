# THE **MERN** STACK — INTRODUCTION

In the modern days, the influence of JavaScript is growing rapidly. In olden days, JavaScript only runs inside the browser and you have to choose different language like [PHP](https://www.php.net/) or [Python](https://python.org) to build the server-side of the web applications. Now-a-days there are many technologies developed to help you create a complete full-stack web application only using JavaScript including both client-side and server-side. The **MERN** stack is a JavaScript stack where you need only JavaScript to work with a specific technology without the need of other programming language.

The each letter in the **MERN** stack represents a technology.

* M — MongoDB - a database solution
* E — Express - a Node.js framework
* R — React - a front-end library
* N — Node - a JavaScript run-time environment

We'll combine the powers of React with the server-side environment developed using Node, Express, MongoDB to create amazing full-stack web applications.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org) is the most popular front-end framework which is used to create blazing-fast dynamic user interface using JavaScript. It was released to the world by Facebook in 2013. It was the main driving technology of most popular web and mobile applications such as Facebook and Instagram. It makes the development of user inferface easy by dividing it into several resuable components. It can create dynamic web applications using the state mechanism, updating and rendering the right UI component when a specific data changes. It uses the concept of **virtual DOM** which is different from browser's DOM to make the applications faster than ever. It makes easy for developers to create an maintain resuable, dynamic and complex user interfaces.

In this tutorial, you use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for styling the front-end. Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications. We can focus on the server-side code insted of struggling to make the client-side more effective.

## Node

Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment. It makes JavaScript code accessible outside the browser. Node.js is built on top of the Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and it's mainly used to create server-side applications. Node.js is simple, extremely fast and handles program asynchronously. Node.js provides an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous, non-blocking I/O which makes it faster than other programming languages. Node has extremely huge collection of libraries called [npm](https://npmjs.org)(**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager) which makes your development process easier. There are more than 500,000 open source packages you can freely use. In fact you have to install React, Express into your project using npm. Instead of [npm](https://npmjs.org) you can also use [yarn](https://yarnjs.org) which is also a node package manager.

## Express

Express is a framework of Node.js which makes the development of server easier than ever. It extends the features of Node.js and provides an easy to use framework for building a powerful server with even less lines of code. It makes the dynamic routing easier and you can add any compatible middleware functions for extending its functionality. Middleware is a function that have access to the request and response of a HTTP request and also the next function in request-response cycle.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is the database solution we use for int his project. It is a No-SQL database. It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.
